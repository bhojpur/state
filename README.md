# Bhojpur State - Foundation Framework

The `Bhojpur State` is a very secure, high performance, decentralized state management engine
applied within the [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform/) for delivery
of distributed `applications` or `services`. It is a primary software framework underlying
the [Bhojpur Chain](https://github.com/bhojpur/chain/) (i.e. BlockChain development kit).
